![Dashboard Preview](./Screenshot%202025-04-18%20235704.png)

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Spotify music data to uncover insights into song popularity, artist trends, album performance, and label distribution. Using a combination of Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, it demonstrates a full-stack data analytics approach from raw data to interactive dashboard.

Built as a **portfolio project** tailored for **recruiters**, it showcases my technical and analytical skills in data storytelling, exploration, and visualization.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to blend multiple tools across the analytics pipeline — from raw data handling in Excel, transformation in Python/SQL, to final visualization in Power BI.
- Designed a dashboard that not only looks visually appealing but also tells a compelling data story.
- Practiced delivering recruiter-ready data portfolios with business context and performance insights.

---

## 🔧 Potential Improvements

- Integrate **Spotify Web API** for real-time or up-to-date data
- Add **predictive modeling** (e.g., to estimate next top artist or genre trends)
- Deploy dashboard online using **Power BI Service** or web apps
